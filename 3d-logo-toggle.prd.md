# Overview
Implement a toggleable 3D version of the logo that seamlessly integrates with the existing theme system and maintains performance through lazy loading.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to toggle between 2D and 3D logo views while maintaining the current theme
- As a user, I want the toggle state to persist between sessions
- As a user, I want smooth transitions between logo states
- As a user, I want the page to load quickly without being impacted by the 3D functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Lazy load Three.js and 3D assets
- Implement React.Suspense for loading states
- Initialize Three.js only when 3D view is active
- Optimize 3D model for web performance

### Integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing theme system
- Support noise overlay feature
- Preserve current shadow effects
- Match existing logo dimensions and positioning

### State Management
- Extend useThemeStore to include logo toggle state
- Persist user preference in localStorage
- Support theme-specific 3D logo variations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create Logo3D component structure
2. Implement lazy loading system
3. Add basic toggle functionality
4. Extend theme store for logo preference

### Phase 2: Enhancement
1. Add loading states and transitions
2. Implement theme-specific 3D variations
3. Add persistence layer
4. Optimize performance

### Phase 3: Polish
1. Add animations and transitions
2. Implement fallback states
3. Add error boundaries
4. Performance testing and optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Components
- LogoContainer (wrapper)
  - Logo (existing 2D)
  - Logo3D (new)
  - LogoToggle (new)

### State Management
```typescript
interface ThemeState {
  // Existing
  theme: string;
  noiseEnabled: boolean;
  // New
  logo3DEnabled: boolean;
  setLogo3DEnabled: (enabled: boolean) => void;
}
```

## Success Metrics
- Load time impact < 100ms for initial page load
- 3D logo load time < 500ms
- Smooth transitions (60fps)
- Memory usage increase < 20MB when 3D enabled

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional logo variations
- Theme-specific 3D effects
- Animation presets
- Mobile performance optimizations
- AR/VR compatibility
